= Project: {Blink_TDev_IBM_CallForCodeMay2020}

This sketch takes a text input from an IoT broker you subscribe to, 
and sends the payload to your board

The input commands will turn the LED light of your board ON or OFF.

Using the NB IOT network with a Telstra SIM, the MKR NB 1500 can be contacted from anywhere

You can send the input command remotely

In the Repo, is the outline of the end network architecture: https://github.com/MichelleHowie/TelstraDevArduinoNodeRedBlink/blob/master/project%20flow%20TelstraDev%20CallForCode%20May2020.jpg 

== Step 1: Set-Up the Arduino Board
To set-up your board, and connect to the NB IoT cellular network, 
Follow the Arduino MKR NB 1500 Get Started Guide on TelstraDev IoT Marketplace

https://dev.telstra.com/sites/default/files/assets/Arduino-MKR-NB-1500-Starter-Guide.pdf 

== Step 2: Register the Devices in WatsonIoT
Login to IBM Cloud

go to catalogue and find the IoT platform: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform 

create a lite (free) plan

go to devices and 'add device'

enter a meaningful device type (e.g "arduinomkr")

enter a meaningful name (e.g "mydevice1")

all the other fields are optional

select 'Finish'

STOP! make sure you copy all the text on this page: ORG, DEVICE TYPE, DEVICE, AUTH METHOD, AUTH TOKEN
IMPORTANT! you will not have access to the token again. save this somewhere you can access it. 
If you lose your device token, you will need to add a new device and start again.

you then need to create a new app from the left screen toolbar. Generate API Key

save your api key and token. they will be needed in your node red instance

change the role of this app to be backend trusted app

== Step 3: Create NodeRed instance
Go to https://nodered.org/

If you have an Openshift account, you can run an instance in IBM cloud,
You can select a local instance of nodered.

Import the Blink_TelstraDev_IBM_Demo.json file containing the demo flow
https://github.com/MichelleHowie/TelstraDevArduinoNodeRedBlink/blob/master/NodeRed_Flow_Blink_TelstraDev_IBM_Demo.json

Here is a schematic of what it should look like: 
https://github.com/MichelleHowie/TelstraDevArduinoNodeRedBlink/blob/master/project%20flow%20TelstraDev%20CallForCode%20May2020.jpg

nodes:
1. http in: the URL endpoint for our virtual mobile number. SMS' are pushed here in an API call from Telstra Messaging API

  Method: POST
  URL: /sms
  
**must append /api/sms to the API call you make in Telstra Messaging API in step 4
  
2. function: strips message payload and converts to lower case
  
  msg.payload = msg.payload.body.toLowerCase();
  return msg;
  
3. switch: data validation, 'on' OR 'off' payloads (case sensitive) go to the EventSender. else, output in a debug

4. debug: show output of the switch IF it was not 'on' OR 'off' 

5. ibmiotout (EventSender): publishes payload to topic in watson iot

  Authentication: API Key
  API Key
    Server Name: [YOUR_ORG].messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com
  Output Type: Device Command
  Device Type: as you defined for the device in step 2
  Device Id: as you defined for the device in step 2
  Event Type:
  Format: text
  Data:data
  

== Step 4: Set-Up Messaging API

Register your free developer account at https://dev.telstra.com.

Login and navigate to the My apps page.

Create your application by clicking the 'Add new app' button

Select API Free Trial Product when configuring your application. This Product includes the Telstra Messaging API as well as other free trial APIs. Your application will be approved automatically.

There is a maximum of 1000 free messages per developer. Additional messages and features can be purchased by creating a company and adding billing details. 

Note your Client key and Client secret as these will be needed to provision a number for your application and for authentication.

Now head over to Getting Started where you can find a postman collection as well as some links to sample apps and SDKs to get you started.

Download the MessagingAPI-SDK in the language of your choice from https://github.com/telstra 

  Get Token
  Get Subscriptions (define the NotifyURL endpoint in this call)
  Note the new subscription mobile number / MSISDN (e.g 61412345678). This is your virtual number
  Send a text to your new virtual number

The notifyURL in the Provisoning call will be the URL where replies to the provisioned number will be posted
Telstra will deliver messages sent to that dedicated number to the notifyURL defined by you. 
The notifyURL should be a complete URL address which includes the protocol identifier (e.g. https://). 
It should also have a forward slash at the end if it is just a domain (e.g. http://www.example.com/).

If that NotifyURL is the correct nodered http in endpoint, you should see the message payload appear in nodered
it's then published to your topic of the mqtt broker in watson iot
the arduino which is polling to that topic will see something has been published, and grab it!
if it's on/off, the sketch running on the device knows what to do!

== Step 4: Prepare Sketch

Add your secrets (token, device name)

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board

Send a text to your virtual number. 

FIN!
